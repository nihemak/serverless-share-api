This is a sample that uses multiple CloudFormation Stacks in the serverless framework.
Share API Gateway and Custom Authorizer on multiple stacks.
It can avoid the limit of 200 resources of CloudFormation Stack.

```
.
├── setup.sh        ... Build a confirmation environment.
├── buildspec.yml   ... For CodeBuild. Do serverless deploy.
├── api-gateway     ... API Gateway stack. Share API Gateway and Custom Authorizer.
├── service-hello   ... Lambda stack. Use API Gateway and Custom Authorizer.
├── service-goodbye ... Lambda stack. Use API Gateway and Custom Authorizer.
└── common          ... Common functions.
```

Build a confirmation environment.
